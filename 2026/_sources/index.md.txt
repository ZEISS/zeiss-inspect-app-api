# ZEISS INSPECT 2025 App Development Documentation 

Welcome to the [ZEISS INSPECT 2026 App](https://www.zeiss.com/metrology/en/software/zeiss-inspect/zeiss-inspect-apps.html) development documentation. With Apps, you will be able to customize and extend the functionality of your ZEISS INSPECT software. 
You can include several template configurations from the software, as well as completely new workflows programmed in Python.

```{important}
Creating Apps is a rather advanced topic, so you should be familiar with the basic inspection concept of ZEISS INSPECT beforehand. New to ZEISS INSPECT? You find an introduction in the ZEISS Quality Tech Guide:
