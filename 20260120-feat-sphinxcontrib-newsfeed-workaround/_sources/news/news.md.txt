![Workflow Assistant](../howtos/workflow_assistant/assets/inspection-basic_inspections-diameter_inspections.png)

The workflow assistant provides a new user interface for built-in ZEISS INSPECT commands or functions provided by Apps. It allows to organize these commands or functions in a user-friendly and efficient way.

See <a href="../howtos/workflow_assistant/workflow_assistant.html">How-to Guides &ndash; Workflow Assistant</a> for more information and <a href="https://github.com/ZEISS/zeiss-inspect-app-examples/tree/main/AppExamples/misc/WorkflowAssistants">App Examples &ndash; Workflow Assistants</a> for an example.

Did you know? Coordinates are often represented as `gom.Vec3d` objects in ZEISS INSPECT Apps. The `gom_math` module provides some functions for computations on `gom.Vec3d` objects.

See <a href="../howtos/python_api_introduction/python_api_introduction.html#gom-vec3d-and-gom-math">ZEISS INSPECT Python API Introduction &mdash; `gom_vec3d` and `gom_math`</a> for details.

![Manage services dialog](../howtos/using_services/assets/manage_services_dialog_small.png)

In ZEISS INSPECT 2025, services have been introduced. A ZEISS INSPECT service is a Python script running continuously in the background, which exposes API functions to other scripts. Services can be distributed via Apps and can be used as computation kernels or callback targets. See <a href="../howtos/using_services/using_services.html">Using services</a> and <a href="../python_api/python_api.html#gom-api-services">Service API</a> for details.

![Configure file selection dialog](../howtos/python_api_introduction/assets/configure_file_selection.png)

With ZEISS INSPECT 2025, it is possible to add a dialog for selecting files or folders by using RMB ► Insert ► File... in the script editor. See <a href="../howtos/python_api_introduction/file_selection_dialog.html">Selecting a file or folder</a> for details. This serves as a shortcut to creating a <a href="../howtos/user_defined_dialogs/user_defined_dialogs.html">User-defined dialog</a> if only a single file widget is needed.

The quality of Apps can be enhanced by thorough testing. Sometimes not only the test results, but also the amount of code covered by the test suite is of interest. This is addressed by the new section <a href="../howtos/testing_apps/testing_apps.html#running-app-tests-with-code-coverage">Running App tests with code coverage</a> of the chapter <a href="../howtos/testing_apps/testing_apps.html">Testing Apps</a>.

The App Editor and the Dialog Designer provide an easy and convenient way of adding a graphical user interface to your App &mdash; see <a href="../howtos/user_defined_dialogs/user_defined_dialogs.html">User-defined dialogs</a>. GUIs which are created this way seamlessly integrate into the look and feel of ZEISS INSPECT. However, there are reasons why using a separate Python GUI library might be preferred. <a href="../howtos/using_gui_libraries/using_gui_libraries.html">Using an additional Python GUI library</a> gives a brief overview on use-cases, options and installation.

Stages are used in ZEISS INSPECT for comparing inspection results of the same nominal part but different actual meshes. In ZEISS INSPECT Correlate, stages are used for 3D image series. <a href="../howtos/stages/stages.html">Working with stages</a> provides some basic information about using stages in Apps and shows typical applications of Python scripts for working with stages.

## [reference_points_and_mesh_data](https://github.com/ZEISS/zeiss-inspect-app-examples/blob/main/AppExamples/data_interfaces/ReferencePointsAndMeshData/doc/Documentation.md)

This example demonstrates how to access reference points in a measurement and meshes from Python.

## [point_pixel_transformations](https://github.com/ZEISS/zeiss-inspect-app-examples/blob/main/AppExamples/misc/PointPixelTransformations/doc/Documentation.md)

This example addresses a fundamental topic of photogrammetry - transformation between 2D pixel coordinates in a measurement and a 3D point coordinate and vice versa.
