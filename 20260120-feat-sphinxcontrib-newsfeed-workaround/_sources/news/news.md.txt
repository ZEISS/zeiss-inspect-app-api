![Workflow Assistant](../howtos/workflow_assistant/assets/inspection-basic_inspections-diameter_inspections.png)

The workflow assistant provides a new user interface for built-in ZEISS INSPECT commands or functions provided by Apps. It allows to organize these commands or functions in a user-friendly and efficient way.

See <a href="../howtos/workflow_assistant/workflow_assistant.html">How-to Guides &ndash; Workflow Assistant</a> for more information and <a href="https://github.com/ZEISS/zeiss-inspect-app-examples/tree/main/AppExamples/misc/WorkflowAssistants">App Examples &ndash; Workflow Assistants</a> for an example.

## Update: Using Visual Studio Code as App Editor

*2025-05-16 14:00*

The interface between ZEISS INSPECT and Visual Studio Code for App development and debugging has been re-implemented for enhanced reliability and additional features.

See <a href="../howtos/using_vscode_editor/using_vscode_editor.html">Using Visual Studio Code as App editor</a> and <a href="../howtos/using_services/using_services.html#debugging-services">Using services &ndash; Debugging services</a> for details.

## Using the 'gom_vec3d' and 'gom_math' modules

*2025-01-23 11:00*

Did you know? Coordinates are often represented as `gom.Vec3d` objects in ZEISS INSPECT Apps. The `gom_math` module provides some functions for computations on `gom.Vec3d` objects.

See <a href="../howtos/python_api_introduction/python_api_introduction.html#gom-vec3d-and-gom-math">ZEISS INSPECT Python API Introduction &mdash; `gom_vec3d` and `gom_math`</a> for details.

## Services

*2024-12-12 12:00*

![Manage services dialog](../howtos/using_services/assets/manage_services_dialog_small.png)

In ZEISS INSPECT 2025, services have been introduced. A ZEISS INSPECT service is a Python script running continuously in the background, which exposes API functions to other scripts. Services can be distributed via Apps and can be used as computation kernels or callback targets. See <a href="../howtos/using_services/using_services.html">Using services</a> and <a href="../python_api/python_api.html#gom-api-services">Service API</a> for details.

---

## Testing Apps with dialogs

*2024-12-05 12:00*

Did you know that you can test Apps with <a href="../howtos/user_defined_dialogs/user_defined_dialogs.html">User-defined Dialogs</a> non-interactively?

See <a href="../howtos/testing_apps/testing_apps.html#testing-apps-with-dialogs">How-to: Testing Apps &mdash; Testing Apps with Dialogs</a> for a detailed explanation.

## Inserting a file selection dialog into a script

*2024-10-28 16:00*

![Configure file selection dialog](../howtos/python_api_introduction/assets/configure_file_selection.png)

With ZEISS INSPECT 2025, it is possible to add a dialog for selecting files or folders by using RMB ► Insert ► File... in the script editor. See <a href="../howtos/python_api_introduction/file_selection_dialog.html">Selecting a file or folder</a> for details. This serves as a shortcut to creating a <a href="../howtos/user_defined_dialogs/user_defined_dialogs.html">User-defined dialog</a> if only a single file widget is needed.

## Selecting elements in scripts

*2024-03-15 09:00*

You have recorded script commands operating on groups of elements selected in the Explorer? The resulting `gom.ElementSelection()` seemed cryptic? You wonder how to access the selection? <a href="../howtos/python_api_introduction/selecting_elements.html">Selecting elements in scripts</a> provides an insight.

---

## Update of Internationalization Tools App

*2024-03-14 15:30*

Did you know that you can easily provide your App's user interface in multiple languages? See <a href="../howtos/localization/localization.html">Localization of Apps</a> for details.

An updated version of the App 'Internationalization Tools' is now available in the ZQS Store.

## How can I access the coordinates of a selection on a mesh?

*2024-03-07 10:00*

The FAQ article <a href="../howtos/faq/faq.html#how-can-i-access-the-coordinates-of-a-selection-on-a-mesh">How can I access the coordinates of a selection on a mesh?</a> explains how you can get the vertices, normals and triangles of parts of a mesh which have been selected interactively.

## Running App tests with code coverage

*2024-02-09 16:00*

The quality of Apps can be enhanced by thorough testing. Sometimes not only the test results, but also the amount of code covered by the test suite is of interest. This is addressed by the new section <a href="../howtos/testing_apps/testing_apps.html#running-app-tests-with-code-coverage">Running App tests with code coverage</a> of the chapter <a href="../howtos/testing_apps/testing_apps.html">Testing Apps</a>.

## Using an additional Python GUI library

*2024-02-05 12:00*

The App Editor and the Dialog Designer provide an easy and convenient way of adding a graphical user interface to your App &mdash; see <a href="../howtos/user_defined_dialogs/user_defined_dialogs.html">User-defined dialogs</a>. GUIs which are created this way seamlessly integrate into the look and feel of ZEISS INSPECT. However, there are reasons why using a separate Python GUI library might be preferred. <a href="../howtos/using_gui_libraries/using_gui_libraries.html">Using an additional Python GUI library</a> gives a brief overview on use-cases, options and installation.

---

## Working with stages

*2024-01-30 11:30*

Stages are used in ZEISS INSPECT for comparing inspection results of the same nominal part but different actual meshes. In ZEISS INSPECT Correlate, stages are used for 3D image series. <a href="../howtos/stages/stages.html">Working with stages</a> provides some basic information about using stages in Apps and shows typical applications of Python scripts for working with stages.

---

## Using Python wheelhouses

*2024-01-30 11:00*

In most cases, Python packages &mdash; also known as Python wheels &mdash; are installed as described in <a href="../howtos/using_app_editor/using_app_editor.html#installing-python-packages">Using the App Editor - Installing Python Packages</a>.

In case this does not work, <a href="../howtos/using_wheelhouses/using_wheelhouses.html">Using Python wheelhouses</a> can provide a solution.

## [reference_points_and_mesh_data](https://github.com/ZEISS/zeiss-inspect-app-examples/blob/main/AppExamples/data_interfaces/ReferencePointsAndMeshData/doc/Documentation.md)

This example demonstrates how to access reference points in a measurement and meshes from Python.

## [point_pixel_transformations](https://github.com/ZEISS/zeiss-inspect-app-examples/blob/main/AppExamples/misc/PointPixelTransformations/doc/Documentation.md)

This example addresses a fundamental topic of photogrammetry - transformation between 2D pixel coordinates in a measurement and a 3D point coordinate and vice versa.
