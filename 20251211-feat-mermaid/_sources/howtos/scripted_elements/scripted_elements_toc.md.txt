# Scripted elements (deprecated)

```{warning}
The scripted elements API is deprecated and will be removed in the next ZEISS INSPECT version. Please use the new [Extensions API](https://zeiss.github.io/zeiss-inspect-app-api/2026/python_api/python_api.html#gom-api-extensions-scriptedelement) instead.
```

The following how-tos will introduce the concept of scripted elements, i.e. elements of the ZEISS INSPECT software that are created by calculation logic written in Python.
